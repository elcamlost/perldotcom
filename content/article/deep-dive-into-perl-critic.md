## INTRO

Write about importance of linters. Some examples from go, js, python, ruby and php. Maybe few words about language server protocol. And some words about perlcritic history
Links to interview with author.

## MY EXPERIENCE

1. Out of the box perl critic doesn't usable in a project and too strict.
2. How to write exceptions.
3. How to write configurations for subtest.
4. How to write own Policy.
5. Lack of Modern Perl features.
6. How to use with CI system.
7. How to use with Intelij

## CONCLUSION

Can be a good tool in your hand, but you need to invest some time to create a policy suitable for your project. Also you need automate runs.
